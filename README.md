This is a project I made for my Data Science Programming class at the County College of Morris. 
This code will scrape five pages of Google Trends (urls are printed in the code output) to answer four different analysis questions.
The code with web scrape the Google Trends pages under the 'Game' category for The United States, Canada, India, Japan, and South Korea.
The only file is WebScrapingFINAL.ipynb which contains the web scraping, data cleaning, and analysis.
